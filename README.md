# MediQueue

A React/Vite and FastAPI prototype for patient pre-consultation and administrator-offered appointment booking.

## Run locally

Install Node.js 22 LTS or later and Python 3.11 or later. Run the backend and frontend in separate PowerShell terminals:

```powershell
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
.venv\Scripts\python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

```powershell
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

## Current behavior

- Database-backed patient registration, password sign-in, and seven-day cookie sessions.
- Separate in-memory patient demo that needs no account.
- Persistent pre-consultation submission with retry-safe IDs.
- Optional verified JPG, PNG, and WebP uploads, limited to three per consultation.
- Administrator review and appointment offers.
- Patient selection and persistent confirmation of one offered appointment.
- Keyboard-accessible forms, validation, mobile navigation, and reduced-motion support.

Use fictional information. Demo answers and images stay in React memory. Signed-in consultation data, verified attachments, offers, and confirmed appointments are stored by the local backend. No AI inference, medical triage, live queueing, clinician workflow, or external hospital scheduling is implemented.

## Create the first admin

No setup is required for local development: startup creates the default admin account and its login requires only the password `Admin1`. To use a custom account, set these optional values before starting the backend:

```powershell
$env:MEDIQUEUE_ADMIN_EMAIL = "admin@example.com"
$env:MEDIQUEUE_ADMIN_NAME = "MediQueue Admin"
# Optional: override the default password
$env:MEDIQUEUE_ADMIN_PASSWORD = "choose-a-strong-private-password"
```

Startup creates or promotes that account and resets its password to the configured value (or `Admin1` when no password is supplied). The admin login form asks only for the password. Keep custom credentials out of frontend configuration and source control; change the default before exposing the service beyond local development.

## Configuration and persistence

The frontend defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Override it in `frontend/.env.local` when needed:

```dotenv
VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Google sign-in is hidden because the backend does not implement verified Google credentials. Local registration and password sign-in remain available.

FastAPI uses SQLite. The schema and safe additive updates live in `backend/app/database.py`; the project does not use separate SQL schema or seed files. Uploaded files use generated names under `uploads/`; metadata lives in SQLite.

Appointment inputs require an explicit timezone. The backend normalizes and stores UTC ISO-8601 values ending in `Z`; browsers render them in the viewer's local timezone. Scheduling conflicts use department plus location, the smallest scheduling resource represented by the current model.

This remains a local prototype. Production requires managed persistence and file storage, HTTPS secure cookies, CSRF protection, verified staff identity, audit trails, retention/deletion controls, isolated image processing, and integration with a real scheduling system.

## Validation

Run the backend suite:

```powershell
cd backend
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -q
```

Run the frontend build and Playwright suite:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run build
npx playwright install chromium
npm test
```

The Playwright configuration starts both FastAPI and the built frontend. It covers the authenticated patient/admin booking flow, persistent confirmation, access control, the demo journey, form validation, mobile navigation, and layout overflow. If Microsoft Edge is already installed, set `PLAYWRIGHT_CHANNEL=msedge` instead of downloading Chromium.
